## Here are five security flaws observed in the app.

- The 'insecure_query_view' function constructs an SQL query using user input without proper validation or parameterization. This can lead to SQL injection attacks.

- The 'vulnerable_template.html' template renders user input directly which could be cause of Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

The SECRET_KEY in 'settings.py' is exposed in the code snippet provided. In a real-world scenario, this key should be kept confidential and not shared publicly.

- The 'DEBUG' mode is set to True in 'settings.py', which exposes sensitive information and create security risks.

- The functionalities can be accessed by just appending the url you want (like /admin) to excisting urls unauthorised.
